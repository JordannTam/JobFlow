# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview
Job Tracker is a serverless API for a full-stack job tracking app. The API is written in TypeScript for AWS Lambda and is meant to be paired with a React frontend. The current repository only contains the API layer.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` — TypeScript source code.
- `src/handlers/` — Lambda handlers (e.g., `hello.ts`).
- `dist/` — Compiled output (generated by the TypeScript build).
- `package.json` — Scripts and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript compiler settings.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` — Install dependencies.
- `npx tsc` — Compile TypeScript into `dist/`.
- `npm test` — Placeholder; currently exits with an error (no test setup yet).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript with `strict` type checking enabled.
- Indentation: 2 spaces (match existing formatting).
- Filenames: `kebab-case` or `camelCase` in `src/` (keep consistent within a folder).
- Lambda handlers should export a single handler function per file when added.

## Testing Guidelines
No testing framework is configured yet. When tests are added:
- Place tests under a `tests/` or `__tests__/` directory.
- Use `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` naming.
- Update `npm test` to run the test runner.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use Conventional Commits:
- Format: `type(scope): summary`
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`
- Example: `feat(api): add create-application handler`
For PRs:
- Include a concise description of changes.
- Link related issues or notes if available.
- Mention local test commands you ran.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets. Use environment variables for AWS keys, Cognito IDs, or API tokens.
- Keep configuration in `.env` files that are excluded from version control.
